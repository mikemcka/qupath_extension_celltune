# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository. It is the single source of truth for build, architecture, and conventions. (`AGENTS.md` is a stub pointing here so other agent tooling resolves it too.)

## What this is

A QuPath 0.7 extension for human-in-the-loop cell classification using dual-model active learning (XGBoost + LightGBM + optional Random Forest). **No Python dependency** — everything runs in Java/JavaFX. It trains two models on the same labels, flags cells where the models disagree, and surfaces those for manual review in an iterative train → review → retrain loop.

## Build & test

Requires a full **JDK 25** (with `javac`) and `JAVA_HOME` set to it (QuPath 0.7 mandates Java 25). Verify with **`javac -version` → `javac 25.x`**, not just `java -version` — a **JRE** 25 passes `java -version` but has no compiler, so `compileJava` fails with a misleading toolchain error (see Troubleshooting below). Use the bundled Gradle wrapper — no separate Gradle install needed.

```bash
# Linux/macOS
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk-25
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
chmod +x gradlew
./gradlew clean compileJava
./gradlew test
./gradlew shadowJar    # → build/libs/qupath-extension-celltune-0.2.1-all.jar
```

```powershell
# Windows
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-25.0.2.10-hotspot"
$env:PATH = "$env:JAVA_HOME\bin;$env:PATH"
.\gradlew.bat clean compileJava
.\gradlew.bat test
.\gradlew.bat shadowJar
```

- `shadowJar` produces the single fat JAR that bundles XGBoost4J + LightGBM4J; **install only this JAR** — partial classpath JARs break native model loading.
- **Run a single test class:** `./gradlew test --tests "qupath.ext.celltune.ui.DistanceMeasurementsDialogTest"` (use `--tests "*.methodName"` for a single method).
- `settings.gradle.kts` pins QuPath `0.7.0` and uses `foojay-resolver-convention` for JDK toolchain resolution; the `qupath-conventions` plugin pins `languageVersion=25`.
- ML deps (`build.gradle.kts`): `ml.dmlc:xgboost4j_2.13:2.1.4` (non-GPU) and `io.github.metarank:lightgbm4j:4.6.0-2`.
- Graph clustering dep (`build.gradle.kts`): `nl.cwts:networkanalysis:1.3.0` (CWTS Leiden/Louvain community detection — the reference implementation the Python `leidenalg`/scanpy/scimap tools trace back to). Powers the Leiden option in the scatter-plot clustering workflow (§11.6). Programmatic API is CLI-documented only — `Network`'s edge-list constructor is `(int nNodes, boolean setNodeWeightsToTotalEdgeWeights, LargeIntArray[] edges, LargeDoubleArray edgeWeights, boolean sortedEdges, boolean checkIntegrity)`; a single-direction, unsorted edge list needs `sortedEdges=false` — passing `true` corrupts the internal CSR adjacency and crashes `LocalMergingAlgorithm`. `LeidenAlgorithm` optimises **CPM**, not Modularity; CPM resolution has no natural "1.0" scale against raw edge weights, so `LeidenModel` builds the network with `setNodeWeightsToTotalEdgeWeights=true` and calls `createNormalizedNetworkUsingAssociationStrength()` before clustering (the same null-model correction Modularity applies) to bring `resolution` back to the familiar scanpy/leidenalg range.
- ANN dep (`build.gradle.kts`): `com.github.jelmerk:hnswlib-core:1.2.1` (pure Java, no native binaries, Apache-2.0) — `HnswKnnIndex` wraps it for both single-image/preview Leiden (`LeidenModel.clusterViaAnn`) and the project-wide **all-cells** cohort mode (`CohortClusterModel.writeClusterAllCells`), replacing brute-force `featureKnn` as the kNN graph source. A runtime recall gate (`LeidenModel.gateAnnRecall`, ≥95% vs the exact brute-force reference on a capped subsample) escalates query-time `ef` on failure and throws `AnnRecallException` — writing **no** labels — if recall still fails after the escalation cap. `HnswKnnIndex`'s `reproducible=true` build path is **best-effort deterministic** only (single-threaded, fixed insertion order): jelmerk 1.2.1's `HnswIndex.assignLevel` draws from `ThreadLocalRandom` with no seed hook and cannot be overridden via subclassing from external source (bytecode-verified) — do not re-attempt a seeded-`assignLevel` subclass without new information. Only the downstream Leiden seed/random-starts are bit-reproducible; graph-topology reproducibility is not guaranteed run-to-run.
- **All-cells cohort mode** (`CohortClusterModel.poolAllCells`/`writeClusterAllCells`, wired into `ScatterPlotView`'s project-scope "Cluster all cells" radio option): a true-scanpy `sc.tl.leiden`-style two-pass driver that pools **every** cell across the selected images (no sample cap) into one HNSW graph, runs a **single** Leiden partition over the whole cohort, then re-reads each image and writes the `Cluster` measurement back by each cell's **packed `(msb,lsb)` `PathObject.getID()` UUID** — a deliberate, phase-specific deviation from this codebase's usual `getID().toString()` UUID-as-string convention (used everywhere else at per-image, not per-cohort, scale). Do not "fix" this back to `.toString()`; at tens of millions of pooled cells the packed-primitive form avoids ~10-20x string/object overhead. Retained alongside it: "Transfer from sample" (Phase 14's `sc.tl.ingest`-style kNN label transfer), selectable via the same radio pair. `CohortClusterModel.CancellationToken` is the only true mid-run cancellation primitive in this codebase (a single `AtomicBoolean`, checked at phase boundaries and between images) — do not confuse it with the pre-flight dialog-decline "cancellations" elsewhere in `ScatterPlotView`.
- **Fidelity gaps vs stock scanpy** (documented, not defects — see USER_GUIDE.md §11.5): (1) CWTS Leiden optimises CPM, not scanpy's default modularity/RBConfiguration; (2) SNN/Jaccard edge weighting, not UMAP fuzzy-simplicial-set connectivities. An external `sc.tl.leiden` run on the same data is not guaranteed to reproduce bit-identical cluster boundaries.
- **Conditional PCA before the clustering kNN graph** (`ScatterMath.pcaReduce`, closing former fidelity gap #3): mirrors scanpy's `scale -> PCA -> neighbors` recipe. Applied to the z-scored active/pooled marker matrix before both k-means and Leiden (`ScatterPlotView`'s preview fit, `CohortClusterModel.writeClusterAllCells`'s all-cells driver, and the Leiden transfer path), never before the 2D PCA/UMAP display embedding (display-only, unaffected). No-op below `ScatterMath.PCA_DEFAULT_THRESHOLD` (50) active marker columns or when the "Reduce dims (PCA)" checkbox (`celltune.clusterPcaEnabled` pref, default on) is off — the small-panel path is byte-identical to the pre-PCA behaviour. Uses `smile.feature.extraction.PCA` (exact covariance eigendecomposition, no randomized SVD) so the reproducible-seed clustering path stays bit-stable; above `ScatterMath.PCA_DEFAULT_FIT_SAMPLE_CAP` (100k) rows, the projection is FIT on a deterministic seeded (42, independent of the caller's own reproducibility toggle) subsample and then APPLIED to every row — bounding fit cost/memory independent of total pooled cell count at cohort scale. Per-cluster centroids (`CohortClusterModel.centroidsAndCounts`, the preview fit's heatmap centroids) are ALWAYS computed in the original z-scored MARKER space from the resulting labels, never the PCA space — do not pass the PCA-reduced matrix into centroid computation. The Leiden kNN-transfer cohort-assign path (`CohortClusterModel.assignAcrossProjectLeiden`/`writeClusterAcrossProjectLeiden`) takes a `queryProjector` (`UnaryOperator<double[][]>`, identity when PCA was not applied) so each query image's z-scored rows are projected into the SAME PC space the fitted Leiden reference lives in before the kNN vote — query and reference must never live in mismatched spaces.

### Install in QuPath

**Delete any older `qupath-extension-celltune-*-all.jar` from the extensions folder first**, then copy the new fat JAR in and restart QuPath fully. QuPath loads every JAR in the folder, so a leftover old version can be loaded instead of the new one — the symptom is unchanged behaviour after an "update" (e.g. a known-fixed bug still reproducing). Keep exactly one CellTune JAR present.

- Windows: `C:\Users\<you>\QuPath\v0.7\extensions\`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/QuPath/v0.7/extensions/`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/QuPath/v0.7/extensions/`

Troubleshooting: build fails with toolchain errors → confirm `JAVA_HOME` points to a full **JDK 25 with `javac`** (see the toolchain note below). No menu entries → confirm the new JAR is in the correct folder and QuPath was restarted fully. Old behaviour persists after updating → an older CellTune JAR is still in the extensions folder; delete it so only the new one remains. Native model issues → use the shadow JAR only, never partial classpath JARs.

#### Toolchain gotcha: "JvmVendorSpec … does not have member field 'IBM_SEMERU'" (really means "no JDK 25")

The wrapper pins Gradle `9.2.1`, and Gradle needs a **JDK 25** toolchain (with `javac`) to run `compileJava` (`languageVersion=25`). If no JDK 25 is found, Gradle falls back to toolchain **auto-provisioning**, which trips a bug in the pinned `foojay-resolver-convention` `0.9.0` plugin on Gradle 9.x and throws a misleading error:

```
Class org.gradle.jvm.toolchain.JvmVendorSpec does not have member field
'org.gradle.jvm.toolchain.JvmVendorSpec IBM_SEMERU'
```

This is **not** a plugin or code problem — it means Gradle couldn't find a local JDK 25, so it tried to download one. The usual cause is that `JAVA_HOME` points to a **JRE** 25 (has `java` but no `javac`), which `java -version` won't reveal. Diagnose and fix:

```bash
javac -version                 # must print "javac 25.x"; if "command not found", JAVA_HOME is a JRE
./gradlew javaToolchains       # lists detected JDKs; a JRE shows "Is JDK: false" and is unusable for compiling
```

Fixes (in order of preference): (1) point `JAVA_HOME` at a full JDK 25; (2) if the JDK lives elsewhere, add it explicitly and stay offline so Gradle never enters the broken auto-provision path — `./gradlew compileJava -Dorg.gradle.java.installations.paths=/path/to/jdk-25 -Dorg.gradle.java.installations.auto-download=false` (or put those two keys in `$GRADLE_USER_HOME/gradle.properties`). Do **not** try to "fix" this by editing the foojay/Gradle versions — supplying a real JDK 25 sidesteps the buggy code path entirely. (A separate, unrelated symptom on shared/network filesystems is `The contents of the immutable workspace … have been modified` — that's Gradle cache corruption; clear `$GRADLE_USER_HOME/caches/<gradle-version>/transforms` and rebuild.)

### Static analysis (SpotBugs)

SpotBugs is wired as a **reporting-only** task (`ignoreFailures = true`) — it never breaks the build and is intentionally not part of `check` until the baseline is triaged.

```bash
./gradlew spotbugsMain        # analyses main sources only (test sources are skipped)
# → open build/reports/spotbugs/main.html
```

Treat findings as a backlog to work down, not a gate. Don't add it as a failing `check` dependency without first triaging the existing baseline.

### Formatting (Spotless + palantir-java-format)

Code formatting is enforced by **Spotless** using **palantir-java-format** `2.93.0` (4-space indent, 120-col lines — chosen to match the existing style). Unlike SpotBugs, it is **blocking** (`isEnforceCheck = true`): `spotlessCheck` is wired into `check`, so an unformatted tree fails `./gradlew check` (and CI).

```bash
./gradlew spotlessApply        # reformat all sources in place (run this before committing)
./gradlew spotlessCheck        # verify formatting without editing (exits non-zero on drift)
```

Steps applied: `palantirJavaFormat` + `removeUnusedImports`. Set `isEnforceCheck = false` in `build.gradle.kts` to make formatting reporting-only again.

> **JDK 25 note:** the palantir-java-format version is pinned to `2.93.0` deliberately — older releases (e.g. 2.50.0) call an internal javac method (`Log$DeferredDiagnosticHandler.getDiagnostics()`) whose signature changed in JDK 25 and crash with `NoSuchMethodError`. Don't downgrade below a JDK-25-compatible release.

## Architecture

Entry point: `src/main/java/qupath/ext/celltune/CellTuneExtension.java` — registers menus, docks the sidebar panel, and manages project-level state. Data flows as the active-learning loop: seed labels → train dual classifiers → inspect inter-model confusion → review disagreement cells → merge labels → retrain.

| Package | Key Classes | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `model/` | `CellFeatureExtractor`, `LabelStore`, `FeatureNormalizer`, `CellPrediction`, `CellTypeTable`, `PopulationSet`, `CohortAnomalyAnalyzer`, `CohortAnomalyReport`, `IntensityHeatmap`, `ImagePixelStats`, `ImagePixelStatsReader`, `PixelCohortAnalyzer`, `PixelCohortReport`, `NeighborhoodModel`, `NeighborhoodCohort`, `CohortClusterModel`, `LeidenModel`, `HnswKnnIndex`, `AnnRecallException` | Feature extraction, label storage, normalization, cell predictions, population definitions, cohort-level anomaly scoring, per-class mean marker-intensity heatmap computation. The `ImagePixelStats`/`Pixel*` classes power the **cells-free image pixel prescreen** (§17): whole-image per-channel pixel stats (incl. Laplacian-variance focus) read off a low-res pyramid level, contextualised against the cohort with the same robust-z machinery; flags are background-heavy, saturated, weak-signal, and **signal-gated intensity-outlier** (per-channel `p99` z on channels above a foreground floor — dead markers excluded so they can't explode the z). Focus is computed/surfaced but never flagged. `NeighborhoodModel` is the pure, static, JavaFX-free core of the **cellular-neighborhood (CN)** analysis (Schürch/Nolan): STRtree kNN/radius neighbour finding → per-cell cell-type composition vectors → k-means → per-CN mean composition / Shannon diversity / spatial adjacency (all unit-tested against synthetic clouds). `NeighborhoodCohort` is the memory-safe **project-wide** backend — two streaming passes (`sample` pools a bounded, per-image-seeded random sample and fits k-means once; `assignAcrossProject` streams every image, assigns each cell to its nearest centroid, writes the `CN` measurement, and saves). Its passes take a **`List<ProjectImageEntry>`** (not a single `Project`), so images from **multiple projects** can be pooled into one fit and each is read/saved in place via its own entry — no cross-project `.qpdata` copying. **Both passes parallelise one worker per image** via a `BackgroundExecutors` fixed pool (per-image local accumulators merged after join; deterministic regardless of worker count). The open image is matched by entry identity (not name) to reuse the live `ImageData`. See [USER_GUIDE.md §18](USER_GUIDE.md#18-cellular-neighborhoods-spatial-micro-environments). `LeidenModel`/`HnswKnnIndex`/`AnnRecallException` and `CohortClusterModel`'s **all-cells** two-pass mode (`poolAllCells`/`writeClusterAllCells`) power the project-wide "Cluster all cells" Leiden option — see the "Graph clustering dep" / "ANN dep" / "All-cells cohort mode" notes above and [USER_GUIDE.md §11.5](USER_GUIDE.md#115-project-wide-clustering-across-images). |
| `classifier/` | `DualModelClassifier`, `XGBoostModel`, `LightGBMModel`, `RandomForestModel`, `CompositeClassifier`, `CompositeClassificationRule`, `ClassifierState`, `FeaturePruner`, `HyperparameterTuner`, `Resampler`, `ResamplingStrategy`, `TrainingMetrics`, `UncertaintySampler`, `ModelType` | ML training/inference (XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest), composite multi-marker rules, sampling, resampling, hyperparameter tuning |
| `gating/` | `GatingExpression`, `GatingRule` | Marker-based landmark gating (AST expression parser, multi-threshold cascade) |
| `ui/` | `ClassificationPanel`, `BinaryClassifierPanel`, `CompositeClassificationDialog`, `ClassControlDialog`, `PopulationPanel`, `ReviewController`, `ReviewToolbar`, `ManualLabelToolbar`, `FeatureImportanceView`, `FeatureSelectionPane`, `CellTableExportPane`, `TrainingMetricsView`, `ConfusionMatrixView`, `ValidationConfusionMatrixView`, `ProjectPredictionSummaryView`, `IntensityHeatmapView`, `ScatterPlotView`, `ProjectClusteringDialog`, `ClusterPreviewWindow`, `ChannelSelector`, `ClusteringNormalizationPane`, `ImageSelectionPane`, `SelectionHighlightOverlay`, `TrainingTileExtractor`, `DistanceMeasurementsDialog`, `PixelPrescreenView`, `FeatureSelectionPane` | All JavaFX panels, dialogs, and toolbars. `PixelPrescreenView` is the image pixel prescreen table/review window (§17); it reads project images in parallel off a background thread. `FeatureSelectionPane` is the grouped checkbox-tree feature picker (markers / Morphology / Neighbors / Embeddings / Other). `ScatterPlotView` is the interactive PCA/UMAP + k-means/Leiden cell scatter plot (annotation/class gating, cluster-marker subsetting, cluster→class assignment, legend click-to-select); in project scope with Method=Leiden it shows a **"Cluster all cells" (default) / "Transfer from sample"** radio pair (`cohortModeAllCells`/`cohortModeTransfer`, visibility driven by `updateCohortModeVisibility()`) dispatching either to `CohortClusterModel.writeClusterAllCells` (the true-scanpy all-cells two-pass driver, with a soft-ceiling confirm, per-phase progress, a `CancellationToken`-backed Cancel button, and a post-write legend re-sync to the final all-cells cluster count) or the retained `writeClusterAcrossProjectLeiden` transfer path; the interactive/preview Leiden fit itself (both scopes) now routes through `LeidenModel.clusterViaAnn` (HNSW) instead of brute-force. It fits one k-means/Leiden partition on a pooled project sample and assigns/writes cohort-wide via `entry.readImageData()`/`saveImageData()`, never holding the whole project in memory. See [USER_GUIDE.md §11](USER_GUIDE.md#11-cell-scatter-plot--clustering--gating). `NeighborhoodAnalysisDialog` is the non-modal control dialog for **cellular-neighborhood (CN)** clustering — single-image or whole-project scope, with a **Parallel workers** spinner driving the cohort passes; it writes a non-destructive numeric `CN` measurement and, on **Apply names**, the user's CN name as a **`CN Class` metadata string** (QuPath measurements are numeric-only) plus a numeric `CN Class code` that drives the "Color by: CN Class" overlay. In project scope **Apply names is cohort-wide** — `NeighborhoodCohort.applyNamesAcrossProject` streams every run image in parallel, mapping each cell's saved `CN` id → name/code and saving each image. It flips viewer overlays (CN / CN class / diversity) via `MeasurementMapper`. `NeighborhoodHeatmapView` is the CN-by-type enrichment heatmap (z-score-across-rows colouring, name/merge → `CN Class` metadata + `CN Class code`, PNG + CN-frequency CSV export). See [USER_GUIDE.md §18](USER_GUIDE.md#18-cellular-neighborhoods-spatial-micro-environments) |
| `io/` | `ProjectStateManager`, `BinaryClassifierRegistry`, `ClassManager`, `CellTableExporter`, `GroundTruthIO`, `MarkerTableImporter`, `ProjectSummaryCsvExporter`, `PixelStatsCsvExporter` | Export (cell table, ground truth CSV, project summary CSV, pixel-prescreen CSV) and import (marker table, project state); binary classifier registry tracks named classifiers across a project; `ClassManager` backs the Class Control dialog (add/delete/merge/undo-merge on PathClasses + persisted label files) |
| `util/` | `JvmModuleOpener` | Runtime JVM helpers. `JvmModuleOpener.ensureJavaLangOpen()` opens `java.base/java.lang` to unnamed modules at startup (called from `CellTuneExtension.installExtension`) so Smile's native PCA/UMAP load without `--add-opens` launch flags |

The 5-tier weighted uncertainty sampling that builds the review queue lives in `classifier/UncertaintySampler`; see [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md) for the end-user workflows and [RISKS.md](RISKS.md) for the full risk register.

## QuPath 0.7 API notes

Verified against QuPath 0.7.0:

- Extension class implements `qupath.lib.gui.extensions.QuPathExtension` — override `installExtension(QuPathGUI)`, `getName()`, `getDescription()`, `getQuPathVersion()`.
- Add menu items via `qupath.getMenu("Extensions>" + EXTENSION_NAME, true)` (returns/creates a `Menu`).
- All UI text comes from `ResourceBundle.getBundle("qupath.ext.celltune.ui.strings")`.
- Read cell measurements via `PathObject.getMeasurementList().get(name)` — returns `NaN` if missing (default to `0f`).
- Use `qupath.fx.dialogs.Dialogs` (not raw JavaFX `Alert`) for dialogs/notifications.
- Use `PathPrefs.createPersistentPreference(...)` for prefs that survive sessions.
- Non-modal windows: `stage.initOwner(qupath.getStage())` + `Modality.NONE` so QuPath stays usable.

## Key conventions

- **UI thread safety**: Background training/prediction threads must batch all QuPath object updates via `Platform.runLater()`. Never call `setPathClass()` or fire hierarchy events from a background thread directly.
- **QuPath public API only**: Use only `qupath.lib.*` public APIs. No internal or deprecated APIs. APIs to watch: `PathObjectSelectionModel`, `PathClass.fromString()`, `project.getEntry(imageData)`, `qupath.getAnalysisTabPane()`.
- **Null-check project entries**: `project.getEntry(imageData)` returns null when an image is open without a project — always null-check.
- **LabelStore is not thread-safe**: `LabelStore` uses a plain `LinkedHashMap`. Do not access it concurrently from training threads and UI threads.
- **Serialization**: Classifier state and per-image labels are saved as JSON+Base64 via Gson to `<project>/celltune/`. Binary classifiers are stored under `<project>/celltune/binary/` and tracked by `BinaryClassifierRegistry` via `binary-registry.json`.
- **Feature column ordering**: Feature vectors must use the same column ordering at training and inference time. `CellFeatureExtractor` handles this — do not bypass it.
- **Marker name sanitization**: `BinaryClassifierRegistry.sanitizeMarkerName()` is called internally on all marker names to prevent path traversal and ensure safe filesystem use. Do not write marker names to disk paths without going through this method.
- **Class Control background tasks**: Long-running operations in `ClassControlDialog` (delete/merge/undo) run on a single-threaded `bgExecutor` and must re-enable their trigger button in a `finally` block. Failing to do so leaves the button greyed out indefinitely. Catch `Exception` (not just `IOException`) so unchecked failures surface as an error dialog instead of silently disabling the UI.

## Known pitfalls

- **LightGBM SHAP crashes the JVM**: Calling `LGBMBooster.predictForMat(... C_API_PREDICT_CONTRIB)` causes a fatal SIGSEGV. `LightGBMModel.computeMeanAbsShap()` exists but is intentionally not called. Do not re-enable LightGBM SHAP without testing in isolation first.
- **XGBoost4J version lock**: The Java API changed significantly between 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x. The project uses `xgboost4j_2.13:2.1.4` (non-GPU). Do not upgrade without thorough testing — `predictContrib()` (TreeSHAP) behaviour and method signatures may change across major versions. `build.gradle.kts` is the authoritative source for the pinned version.
- **Binary classification SHAP**: For exactly 2 classes, feature importance bars are identical for both classes — this is expected (see [RISKS.md](RISKS.md#24-binary-classification-shap-display)).
- **CompositeClassificationRule validation**: Rules enforce a max of 128 conditions and a max rule name length of 120 characters. Marker names in rules are validated against the live `BinaryClassifierRegistry` at build time.
- **Smile native PCA/UMAP need `java.base/java.lang` opened**: Smile's `PCA` (`Matrix.svd` → OpenBLAS) and `UMAP` (spectral init → ARPACK) load native libraries through JavaCPP, which reflects into `java.lang.Runtime`. Under the Java module system this throws `InaccessibleObjectException` (wrapped in `ExceptionInInitializerError`, then `NoClassDefFoundError` on retries — both `LinkageError`, NOT `Exception`) unless the JVM was started with `--add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED`. `JvmModuleOpener.ensureJavaLangOpen()` (called from `installExtension`) opens it programmatically at startup via `sun.misc.Unsafe` + `IMPL_LOOKUP` → `Module.implAddOpensToAllUnnamed`, so users need no launch flags. This MUST run before any Smile native class is first touched — once `arpack.<clinit>` fails it is poisoned for the JVM's lifetime. `ScatterPlotView` also catches `LinkageError` (not just `Exception`) around the UMAP/embedding call and falls back to PCA as defence-in-depth. The `Unsafe` accessors are deprecated-for-removal; fine through JDK 25, but if a future JDK removes them the opener returns `false` and the PCA fallback / `--add-opens` hint take over.
- **Same-class nearest-neighbour distances must stay O(n log n) AND must self-exclude**: `DistanceMeasurementsDialog.sameClassNearestNeighbourDistances()` uses a JTS `STRtree`. JTS's 3-arg `nearestNeighbour(env, item, ItemDistance)` does NOT automatically exclude the query item — the `ItemDistance` callback must compare item references and return `+Infinity` for a self-match (we use unique `Object` markers per index so reference equality is meaningful). Without this, every cell's "Distance to other X" comes back as 0. Do not replace the STRtree path with a brute-force pairwise loop — at 500k+ cells per image the O(n²) variant takes minutes to hours per class. Annotation and cross-class distances use QuPath's `DistanceTools`, which is already spatially indexed; only the same-class path is owned by this extension. Tests: `ui/DistanceMeasurementsDialogTest`.
