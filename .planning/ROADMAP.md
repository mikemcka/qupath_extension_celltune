### Phase 5 - Verification Artifact Backfill

Goal: Normalize legacy milestone evidence by creating formal phase verification artifacts for phases 1-3.
Depends on: v1.0 archives and existing phase summaries/UAT evidence.
Requirements: EVID-01, EVID-02, EVID-03
Success Criteria:
1. Phase 1 has VERIFICATION artifact mapped to its shipped behaviors.
2. Phase 2 has VERIFICATION artifact covering single-image and batch composite flows.
3. Phase 3 has VERIFICATION artifact for named-rule persistence and apply flows.

- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md - Create phase 3 verification artifact and refresh v1.0 audit evidence (completed 2026-04-29)

### Phase 6 - Nyquist Validation Coverage

Goal: Add Nyquist VALIDATION coverage for all milestone phases and produce explicit compliance status.
Depends on: Phase 5 verification artifacts.
Requirements: NYQ-01, NYQ-02, NYQ-03, NYQ-04
Success Criteria:
1. Each phase 1-4 has VALIDATION artifact with nyquist_compliant field.
2. Validation files include reproducible checks and sampling rationale.
3. Missing-phase warnings in audit are removed for Nyquist coverage.
Plans: To be planned

### Phase 7 - Reliability Core Hardening

Goal: Fix core reliability defects in persistence, concurrency safety, and feature-schema validation.
Depends on: Phase 6.
Requirements: REL-01, REL-02, REL-03
Success Criteria:
1. saveState/reload preserves selected features and normalization settings.
2. LabelStore operations are safe under concurrent training and labeling usage.
3. predictOnly rejects mismatched feature name schemas and surfaces actionable errors.
Plans: To be planned

### Phase 8 - UX Safety and Explainability Polish

Goal: Improve user-facing safety feedback and binary explainability display behavior.
Depends on: Phase 7.
Requirements: UX-01, UX-02
Success Criteria:
1. Out-of-project labeling attempts show explicit warning.
2. Binary SHAP display avoids duplicate class views and uses a single coherent mode.
Plans: To be planned

### Phase 9 - Regression Tests for Hardening

Goal: Add automated tests covering reliability and verification hardening paths.
Depends on: Phases 7-8.
Requirements: TST-01
Success Criteria:
1. New test suite covers persistence, schema validation, and key verification-path regressions.
2. CI or local test command demonstrates stable pass for new hardening tests.
Plans: To be planned

### Phase 10 - Documentation and Governance Refresh

Goal: Review recent summary-dialog delivery and align planning plus user/build documentation.
Depends on: Phase 5 baseline artifacts and current summary feature implementation.
Requirements: GOV-01, DOC-01, DOC-02
Success Criteria:
1. Code review artifact records findings and residual risk for summary feature changes.
2. README documents Project Prediction Summary usage including open-image and CSV export.
3. Dedicated build documentation provides reproducible JDK 25 and Gradle wrapper commands.
Plans: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 10-01-PLAN.md - Review summary code and align planning, README, and build docs (completed 2026-04-29)


## Milestone v1.2 - Cohort Outlier Analytics

Goal: Detect rare cell-type enrichment and image-level composition anomalies from project-wide prediction summaries.

### Phase 11 - Project Summary Cohort Outlier Analytics

Goal: Add cohort baseline analytics, rare-type enrichment ranking, and anomaly-aware project summary review workflows.
Depends on: Phase 10 summary pane baseline and persisted per-image Pred_ALL predictions.
Requirements: COH-01, COH-02, COH-03, COH-04
Success Criteria:
1. Project summary computes per-image enrichment vs cohort baselines for predicted classes.
2. Project summary computes robust anomaly scores for unusual composition and disagreement behavior.
3. Summary UI can filter flagged images and target specific rare cell classes for review.
4. CSV export includes anomaly fields and automated tests cover scoring and export schema.
Plans: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 11-01-PLAN.md - Build cohort anomaly scoring contracts and analytics engine with tests (completed 2026-04-30)
- [x] 11-02-PLAN.md - Integrate anomaly insights into summary UI filters and CSV export (completed 2026-04-30)

## Milestone v1.3 - Cross-Project Binary Ground Truth Portability

Goal: Move binary classifier training evidence between projects so marker-specific classifiers can be reconstructed without relabelling from scratch.

### Phase 12 - Binary Ground Truth Bundle Export/Import

Goal: Export ground truth measurements from all registered binary classifiers in one project and import them into another project with schema-aware merge behavior.
Depends on: Phase 1 binary classifier registry/persistence and existing ground-truth CSV import/export foundations.
Requirements: XFER-01, XFER-02, XFER-03, XFER-04
Success Criteria:
1. A single export action produces a bundle containing marker-wise ground-truth measurements for every registered binary classifier with available training rows.
2. Importing a bundle registers missing binary classifiers in the target project and persists imported training rows per marker.
3. Import flow reports per-marker outcomes (imported, replaced, skipped, schema mismatch) without corrupting existing classifier state.
4. Automated tests cover bundle round-trip, malformed bundle handling, and merge/replace behavior.
Plans: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 12-01-PLAN.md - Build bundle contract, persistence hooks, and automated round-trip tests
- [ ] 12-02-PLAN.md - Wire QuPath menu actions and guided import/export workflow with verification checkpoint

## Milestone v1.4 - Cellular Neighborhood Analytics

Goal: Partition tissue into recurring spatial micro-environments by clustering each cell on its local cell-type composition (Schürch/Nolan cellular neighborhoods), non-destructively, on the current image.

### Phase 13 - CN Spatial Clustering

Goal: Add cellular-neighborhood (CN) spatial clustering: per-cell local composition vectors → k-means → non-destructive CN measurement, with an enrichment heatmap, CN-frequency CSV, and a Classification ⟷ CN viewer color toggle.
Depends on: Existing scatter/cluster machinery (ScatterPlotView, ScatterMath, CohortClusterModel), DistanceMeasurementsDialog STRtree pattern, and IntensityHeatmapView.
Requirements: CN-01, CN-02, CN-03, CN-04
Success Criteria:
1. Each cell on the current image gets a CN from its local-neighborhood cell-type composition (kNN or radius) derived from live classifications.
2. CN is stored as a non-destructive numeric measurement; phenotype (getPathClass()) is unchanged.
3. Dialog provides a CN × cell-type enrichment heatmap, a per-image CN-frequency CSV, and a non-destructive Classification ⟷ CN color toggle.
4. Automated tests cover neighbor finding (kNN + radius, self-excluded), composition normalization, clustering, and per-CN mean composition.
Plans: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 13-01-PLAN.md - Build NeighborhoodModel + dialog + enrichment heatmap/CSV + menu wiring with unit tests (filed from prior plan-mode draft)


## Milestone v1.5 - Graph-based Phenotype Clustering

Goal: Add Leiden graph-based community detection as a selectable alternative to k-means in the interactive Scatter Plots & Clustering (phenotyping) workflow, for both current-image and whole-project scope — the field-standard method (scanpy/scimap/SPACEc) for resolving non-spherical and rare cell populations.

### Phase 14 - Leiden Phenotype Clustering

Goal: Add a Method {k-means, Leiden} selector to the scatter clustering dialog; Leiden builds a feature-space kNN graph (Jaccard-weighted) and runs the CWTS Leiden algorithm with a resolution control and reproducibility toggle, reusing the existing colouring/legend/assignment machinery and adding a kNN label-transfer path for cohort scope.
Depends on: Existing scatter/cluster machinery (ScatterPlotView, ScatterMath, CohortClusterModel) and the k-means multi-restart reproducibility pattern (NeighborhoodModel). Research: .planning/notes/leiden-clustering-design.md.
Requirements: LEI-01, LEI-02, LEI-03, LEI-04, LEI-05
Success Criteria:
1. Dialog offers Method {k-means, Leiden}; Leiden shows resolution + reproducibility controls and decides the cluster count.
2. Leiden clusters the same z-scored active matrix via kNN graph + CWTS Leiden and drives colouring/legend/assignment identically to k-means.
3. Project scope fits Leiden on the pooled sample and assigns all cells across images via kNN label transfer; k-means cohort path unchanged.
4. Automated tests cover feature kNN, community recovery, resolution behaviour, reproducibility, and label transfer.
Plans: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 14-01-PLAN.md - Bundle CWTS Leiden + build LeidenModel (kNN graph/Leiden/label transfer), wire Method selector + resolution/reproducibility controls, cohort kNN-transfer, docs, with unit tests
